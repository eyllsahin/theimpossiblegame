# Final Report: The Impossible Game

## Project Objectives
The Impossible Game was developed to merge engaging gameplay with educational content, making complex physics concepts accessible and enjoyable. The goal was to create a fighting game where players learn about quantum mechanics and gravity through interactive modules and character-driven storytelling.

## Game Design
- **Genre:** 2D Educational Fighting Game
- **Characters:**
  - **Graviton:** Represents gravity, with abilities and educational content focused on gravitational physics.
  - **Quanta:** Represents quantum mechanics, with abilities and educational content focused on quantum phenomena.
- **Core Loop:**
  1. Main menu navigation
  2. Character selection or access to learning modules
  3. Fight scene with health bars, AI opponent, and dynamic camera
  4. Game over and return to character selection
- **Educational Integration:**
  - Each character has a dedicated learning scene with video content.
  - Videos are triggered by UI buttons and cover topics like wave-particle duality, probability, gravity bending, and more.

## Technical Implementation
- **Engine:** Godot 4.4
- **Scripting:** GDScript for all game logic, character AI, UI, and educational modules.
- **Scenes:** Modular scene structure for menus, character selection, learning, and fighting.
- **Assets:** Custom sprites, animations, and educational videos for each character.
- **Input:** Configured in `project.godot` for keyboard controls (arrows, Enter, A, S).
- **AI:** Simple state-based AI for enemy fighters.
- **UI:** Health bars, labels, and video windows implemented with Godot UI nodes.

## Educational Value
- **Interactive Learning:** Players can access learning modules at any time, reinforcing scientific concepts through short, focused videos.
- **Character-Driven Education:** Each character embodies a branch of physics, making abstract concepts relatable.
- **Engagement:** The blend of fighting mechanics and educational content keeps players motivated to learn and play.

## Lessons Learned
- Integrating educational content into gameplay increases engagement and retention.
- Godot's scene system and GDScript are effective for rapid prototyping and modular design.
- Balancing fun and learning requires careful UI/UX design and playtesting.

## Future Improvements
- Expand character roster with new scientific concepts.
- Add multiplayer support.
- Enhance AI complexity and add difficulty levels.
- Include quizzes or interactive challenges in learning modules.

## Conclusion
The Impossible Game demonstrates that educational games can be both fun and informative. By combining fighting gameplay with accessible science content, the project achieves its goal of making physics approachable for a broad audience.
